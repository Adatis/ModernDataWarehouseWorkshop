# Building an Azure Business Intelligence Solution End to End – Hands on Workshop

There are so many ways to ingest, transform, aggregate and visualise our data. Architecting an end to end data warehouse solution now requires a huge breadth of knowledge on a vast amount of data services, or does it? Where do you start? 

In this hands on full day of training we’ll answer those questions. But we won’t stop there. We’ll build the start of your data pipeline, the middle and we’ll build the end.

Using the Microsoft Cloud platform, we’ll learn about the data focused subset of these Azure services and how they can be harnessed to build a working modern cloud based data warehouse solutions.

Specifically, we’ll cover;

* Ingestion of raw data into storage or using real-time data sources with event hubs.
* Preparation and data cleansing with batch service jobs and custom operations.
* Streamed data flowing through aggregated query windows for real-time analytics.
* Transformation using SQL layers and SQL like languages.
* Data modelling using relational theory and complimented by graph theory.
* Aggregation and creation of complex measures with our semantic layer.
* Breaking out the predictive models and cognitive services abilities.
* Rich visualisations and reporting anywhere.
* Orchestration of the entire platform with server less compute and management services.

Have your laptops to hand and come armed with your Azure subscription. We are going to build this!
